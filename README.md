## Homework 4: Coding Quiz

**Version 1.0**

# Description

The purpose of this application is to present the user with a code quiz based on the unit on Web APIs.

Once the user clicks start, he or she is presented with a question. The user chooses what they believe to be the best answer and are presented with a correct or wrong color.

This app is meant to have a timer and high score tracker but I have had difficulty getting the app to function.

I got it functioning thanks to a Youtube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified. While working on this app, I have learned a great deal about debugging thanks to the help of my tutor and AskBCS.
